                                containerResource refers to a resource metric (such as those specified in
                                requests and limits) known to Kubernetes describing a single container in
                                each pod of the current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory). Such metrics are
                                built in to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those
                                available to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.
                                This is an alpha feature and can be enabled by the HPAContainerMetrics feature flag.
