                          - In the future, packages may also define additional resource dimensions

                            Concept:
                              - ResourcePackages are node/numa-oriented.
                              - A ResourcePackage represents a subdivision of the total node/numa resources into
                                standardized units. Each unit may define one or more resource dimensions
                                (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network).
                              - Pods associated with a package must consume resources following the
                                same ratio. If a Pod is not bound to a package, it falls back to
                                the "default" package (or its variants: "default-1", "default-2").
                            Difference vs ResourcePools:
                              - ResourcePackages: split all node/numa resources into standard shapes (abstracting
                                physical resources into units).
                              - ResourcePools: reserve/limit resources for a particular workload type.

                                - A ResourcePackage subdivides the node/numa’s total resources into standardized units.
                                - The most common naming convention is based on CPU:Memory ratio.
                                - Example: "x2" means 1 core : 2 GiB memory, "x8" means 1 core : 8 GiB memory
                                - In the future, packages may also define additional resource dimensions
                                  (e.g., local SSDs, network bandwidth, GPUs).

                                  shape defined in Allocatable.
                                - A special "default" resource package (or "default-N" variants) represents all
                                  remaining resources not explicitly assigned to a named resource package.

                              - They allow a workload type (e.g. GPU jobs, latency-sensitive tasks) to

                              - ResourcePools are for *workload reservations* (claiming resources for
